# An AutoFPGA peripheral demonstration project

This is a demonstration project.  It is designed to show users how simple
peripherals can be incorporated into a design via
[AutoFPGA](https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga).  My plan is to
blog about this design at [zipcpu.com](http://zipcpu.com), and describe how
[various components can be added (or removed) from a design using this design
as
an example.
